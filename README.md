#Spark

Spark is a language fot creating, running and training Neural Networks. Spark provides for syntax which makes it easy to create neural networks with arbritary number of layers, neurons and connections.

Special constructs exist to load data to run and train the networks on, and also to count the errors/mismatches of the network. Currently three training algorithms have been implemented, namely:
1. Perceptron learning
2. Backpropagation training
3. MTiling algorithm
