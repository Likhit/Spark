{"name":"Spark","tagline":"A language for creating, running and training Neural Networks.","body":"#Spark\r\n\r\nSpark is a language for creating, running and training Neural Networks. Spark provides for syntax which makes it easy to create neural networks with arbitrary number of layers, neurons and connections.\r\n\r\nSpecial constructs exist to load data to run and train the networks on, and also to count the errors/mismatches of the network. Currently three training algorithms have been implemented, namely:\r\n1. Perceptron learning\r\n2. Backpropagation training\r\n3. MTiling algorithm\r\n\r\n##Language Features\r\n\r\nSpark along with the interpreter shell provides constructs for learning about neural networks with the help of visualizations. The constructs of the Spark language are listed in this section through the use of an example network which tries to learn the famous Iris dataset.\r\n\r\n###Loading the dataset\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://jsfiddle.net/likhitd/u4ff2/embedded/result\" frameborder=\"0\">Dummy Text</iframe>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
